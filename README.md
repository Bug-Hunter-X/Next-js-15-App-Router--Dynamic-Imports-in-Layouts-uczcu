# Next.js 15 App Router: Dynamic Imports in Layouts

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with dynamic imports within layouts in Next.js 15's App Router.  The issue involves unexpected behavior when attempting to dynamically import components into layouts, leading to hydration mismatches or runtime errors.

## Bug Description

When using dynamic `import()` statements within a layout component,  Next.js may not properly handle the asynchronous loading of the imported modules, potentially resulting in hydration mismatches or runtime errors. This typically manifests as a failure to render the dynamically imported component correctly, or as a hydration error in the browser console.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Navigate to the application in your browser.
5. Observe the behavior (or lack thereof) of the dynamically imported component within the layout.

## Expected Behavior

The dynamically imported component should render correctly within the layout. 

## Actual Behavior

The dynamically imported component either fails to render or causes a hydration mismatch. This is because the dynamic import statement is not properly handled within the layout's rendering lifecycle.
